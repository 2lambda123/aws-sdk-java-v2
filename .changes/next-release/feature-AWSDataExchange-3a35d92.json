    "description": "This release enables data providers to license direct access to data in their Amazon S3 buckets or AWS Lake Formation data lakes through AWS Data Exchange. Subscribers get read-only access to the data and can use it in downstream AWS services, like Amazon Athena, without creating or managing copies."
