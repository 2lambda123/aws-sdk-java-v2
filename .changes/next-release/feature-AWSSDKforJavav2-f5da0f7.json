    "description": "This commit adds a new ErrorType core metric that is recorded for all failed API call attempts. The ErrorType records the general category  of error that ocurred for a failed API call attempt. Those categories are:\n\n - Throttling errors\n - Service errors other than throttling\n - I/O errors\n - API call or API call attempt timeouts\n\n The intent of this metric is to help locate possible issues at a glance and help direct further debugging or investigation."
